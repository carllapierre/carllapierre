### Hello there! 🧙‍♂️

My name is Carl Lapierre, I've been a professional button pusher since around 2015! My weapons of choice are NodeJS/React but I love to dabble in whatever falls onto my lap. Also, I work at OSEDEA 😎! Osedea is a custom software development company that employs probably the most brilliant people I know.
